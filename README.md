# Diversity-from-SFS

In this repositrory i placed some codes to: 

**1-** Estimate diversity measures (pi, Watterson's Theta, number of segregating Sites and Tajima's D) from the unfolded SFS of multiple populations 

**2-** Estimate diversity measures (pi, Watterson's Theta, number of segregating Sites and Tajima's D) from the unfolded SFS in windows across the genome

**3-** Estimate dxy (pi between)from the unfolded 2D-SFS in windows across the genome
